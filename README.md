# AI-Powered Quiz Performance Analyzer

This web application provides users with a dynamic quiz experience and generates a detailed, AI-powered performance report to help them identify strengths, weaknesses, and find relevant learning resources.

## Features

- **Dynamic Quiz Generation:** Creates customized quizzes based on user-selected subjects (Logical Reasoning, Quantitative Aptitude, Verbal Ability), difficulty, and number of questions using the Groq API for fast, on-the-fly generation.
- **Interactive Quiz Interface:** A modern, single-page quiz experience with a question palette for easy navigation, real-time answer checking, and a countdown timer for timed tests.
- **AI Agent for Performance Analysis:** After the quiz, an autonomous agent built with **LangGraph** analyzes the user's performance data.
- **Automated Resource Discovery:** The agent uses the **Tavily Search API** to automatically find relevant YouTube tutorials and practice materials for the user's specific weak topics.

  - An overall performance summary.
  - A clear breakdown of strong and weak topics.
